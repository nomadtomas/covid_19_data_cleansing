## General Information
COVID-19 has taken center stage in our lives recently.  A lot of people are working tirelessly around the clock to mitigate this issue, and to all I am immensely grateful.  I know that there are many people utilizing their own particular skill set to bring about some insight to this disease.  I wanted to contribute my small gain of sand. I merged all csv files from the github repo setup by Johns Hopkins and returned one uniformed ‘clean’ dataset.  I will make daily updates to the file.  All code on how I merged the data can be found under my ```notebooks``` folder.  Cleaned ```csv``` file can be found under ```data``` folder.
